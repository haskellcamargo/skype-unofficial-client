##### Why?

Because Skype native client for Linux sucks a lot.

##### Installation

unix-based systems.

`git clone https://github.com/haskellcamargo/skype-unofficial-client.git`

`sudo make linux_x86` or `sudo make linux_x64`

For Arch Linux users, this application is currently available on [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/skype-desktop-bin/).

##### Developers Note

Skype's Web client running on Node Webkit, doesn't currently support video calls.

The Skype name, associated trade marks and logos and the "S" logo are trade marks of Skype or related entities.
